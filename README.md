CagePlots
=========

Have you ever needed to use some placeholder text when designing a web page? Of course you have. Why use lorem ipsum when you could be using plots from Nicolas Cage films? CagePlots is a collection of Sublime Text 2 snippets which gives you access to the plot of some of Cage's finest work at the press of the tab key. 

Available shortcuts are:

- 8mm
- adaptation
- conair
- driveangry
- faceoff
- ghostrider
- nationaltreasure
- raisingarizona
- therock

The plots are tab triggered. Simply type the shortcut (e.g. therock), press tab, and boom - you've got yourself a cage plot. 

## Installation 

1. Download this repistory as a zip file using the link at the top of this page. 

2. Unzip it and drag it into the ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages folder

3. You're done. Sublime text should automatically give you access to the new commands.
