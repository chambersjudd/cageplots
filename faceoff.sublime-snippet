    <content><![CDATA[Most wanted civil freelance terrorist Castor Troy is relentlessly pursued by FBI Special Agent in Charge Sean Archer (John Travolta). Years earlier, Castor, in an attempt to kill Sean, accidentally killed the agent's young son, Michael; the two have been obsessed with each other ever since. The FBI receives information that Castor's brother, Pollux (Alessandro Nivola), has chartered a plane at LAX airport. Sean knows that Pollux will not fly without Castor, so he leads a joint FBI/LAPD team to chase the plane down, which crashes into a hangar. In the ensuing chaos, Pollux is captured by the FBI and Castor is knocked into a coma after bragging to Sean about a bomb set to obliterate a good portion of L.A., neglecting to mention where it is located. Sean's work colleagues congratulate him on catching Castor, but the agent coldly rebuffs the praise and says the deaths of FBI agents is nothing to celebrate about.]]></content>
