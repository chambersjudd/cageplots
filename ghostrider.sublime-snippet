    <content><![CDATA[While warning the monks of a monastery about an impending attack by the devil's forces to obtain a certain boy named Danny (Fergus Riordan), a French priest named Moreau takes matters into his own hands when the monastery is attacked and tries to help the boy and his mother Nadya (Violante Placido) in their escape, but the distrusting mother shoots at Moreau and manages to escape. Moreau manages to distract the men chasing Danny and Nadya, but nearly dies in the process and loses them. He says that only the Ghost Rider is capable of protecting the boy beyond the solstice which will take place in a few days. Then he would be safe from the devil's influence, and to track them, he would need the Rider's help.]]></content>
